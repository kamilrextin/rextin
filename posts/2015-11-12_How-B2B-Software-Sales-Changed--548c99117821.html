Yet while the mode and medium of modern business has evolved, many of the business strategies and frameworks that powered the old world of commerce are still catching up to those changes. And perhaps none more so than B2B software sales.</p><p name="6095" id="6095" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Business software used to have a much higher price point. Products were monolithic and often required significant on-site implementation costs. The focus of tech sales was getting prospects to close. To sign on the dotted line.</p><p name="3ec6" id="3ec6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But the nature of software evolved. Products and services are now delivered more and more through the web browser, or mobile device. Products have become slimmer in functional scope, more lightweight and modular, with a generally lower price point.</p><p name="37a7" id="37a7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">And as software has changed, so too has software sales. The old “hard-sell” model is being slowly superseded by a “new customer” success model.</p><p name="5e99" id="5e99" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So let’s explore:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="8b0d" id="8b0d" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">What is the incumbent “old” model of B2B software sales?</li><li name="679c" id="679c" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">What are the changes in technology that have made this model obsolete?</li><li name="5349" id="5349" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">And what exactly is this shiny new thing called “customer success”?</li></ul><h3 name="8abb" id="8abb" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--li">The Old Model Of Software Sales.</h3><p name="b88c" id="b88c" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--h3"><span class="graf-dropCap">O</span>nce upon a time, before iPhones and broadband wifi, circa 1980–2000’s, implementing business software solutions was a long, slow and costly operation. Offices would be overrun with consultants and specialists for weeks or months at a time.</p><p name="d92a" id="d92a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Business software in that era required “boots on the ground” to implement. Software needed to be installed and tested on each desktop workstation in the office. Some software even needed on-site servers to be setup and configured.</p><p name="fed0" id="fed0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The complexities of such an implementation, meant a shifting timeline for delivery, and a mercurial final cost. Trying software was a business risk — if it didn’t work out, it could mean a big hit to the P&amp;L sheet.</p><p name="df8b" id="df8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Since there was this significant migration cost for switching software solutions, customers stuck around. They bought long term licences. They bought support. For the software sellers, that meant: fewer deals than today, but with higher value.</p><p name="9c42" id="9c42" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This was the old world of business software: big, monolithic solutions, with a hefty price tag and a complex implementation.</p><p name="6ddc" id="6ddc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">This kind of software business required a sizeable sales force that could do “high touch” sales. Done right, the profit margin from high-value long-term contracts could quickly ameliorate the salary cost of sales people and the long lead times.</p><p name="8785" id="8785" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So, this software and sales model was hugely effective and profitable for the tech giants of the 1980’s Cisco, Oracle, Sun etc.</p><p name="b75f" id="b75f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Today it is known as “sales development” (and has been re-popularised recently by Aaron Ross in his sales playbook: <a href="http://predictablerevenue.com/" data-href="http://predictablerevenue.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">“Predictable Revenue”</a>).</p><p name="ea1a" id="ea1a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The basic structure of the sales flow is as follows:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="e59e" id="e59e" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Demand generation:</strong> Create a flow of inbound interest in the product or service (aka marketing).</li><li name="1e4b" id="1e4b" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Lead Qualification:</strong> Qualify potential leads on a spectrum from very-likely-to-be customers, to very-unlikely-to-be customers.</li><li name="c566" id="c566" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Lead Nurturing:</strong> Nudge qualified, interested leads along the buying funnel. Feed them helpful guidance, assistance, be on-hand to answer questions. (More on the this aspect later!).</li><li name="be29" id="be29" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Closing:</strong> The all important closing. Get the leads to sign on the dotted line.</li></ol><p name="21ec" id="21ec" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">It’s worth noting that Aaron Ross emphasises the specialisation of these roles. Sales reps don’t cross disciplines. Your closers are never the same people as your prospectors.</p><p name="4fb9" id="4fb9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Now if your product or service has a high enough price point, this model could absolutely work for you today. Enterprise software sales teams are still working this way, and with great success.</p><p name="e0d3" id="e0d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But the nature of software now has fundamentally changed since the days of Sun and Cisco. Products are, in general, much more lightweight and modular than their 1980’s predecessors. They are not monolithic. They do not attempt to encompass all business challenges. Rather they “unbundle”. They solve specific problems, within a narrower band, and at a fractional cost.</p><p name="6299" id="6299" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Businesses are now free to pick and choose their own custom hybrid solution, comprised from a number of these products and services.</p><p name="2b2a" id="2b2a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So what happened? What changed? Where did the big monolithic software go?</p><p name="232d" id="232d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In short: it was killed by the web browser.</p><h3 name="30c8" id="30c8" class="graf graf--h3 graf-after--p">How the Modern Web Changed Everything</h3><p name="70e2" id="70e2" class="graf graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--h3"><span class="graf-dropCap">T</span>here was a time, not so long ago, when the web was a rather static medium. It was more akin to a digital newspaper, than an interactive application. Tech folks dreamed it could be more, but limited CPU power and internet bandwidth were blocking the way forward.</p><p name="36fe" id="36fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The desktop was the only place a business user could do “serious” work. Think word processors, spreadsheets, graphic design in the 1990’s.</p><p name="3432" id="3432" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">But as processors became increasingly powerful and affordable, as the browser itself became powerful, the possibility of having an application-like experience in the browser (i.e. responsive, fast, data intensive) became a tangible reality.</p><p name="289d" id="289d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">These days it is standard practice for a business to run their core activities and operations through the browser.
