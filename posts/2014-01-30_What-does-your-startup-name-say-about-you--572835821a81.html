To provide some context to our discussion I am working with Sajid on strategy and marketing.</p><p name="6873" id="6873" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Finding the name a little awkward, our conversation began when I asked him if he was open to changing the company name to something more ‘sexy’, ‘buzzy’ (and perhaps generic?) like most digital agencies, start-ups and design studios out there. Its a trendy thing to do, I thought, so why settle for anything else?</p><p name="3c97" id="3c97" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">As I mentioned this to Sajid, he replied thoughtfully that he was open to the idea, but perhaps I should hear him out first, since he had been asked this question many times and he went on to explain that there was a lot of thought that went into the name and what it should stand for. A lot of companies in Pakistan tend to select names that are ‘western’ or ‘sexy’ but without substance — something I agree with. With Ra’ed, he wanted a name that had purpose. Not only should it reflect the company values, but also its roots in the subcontinent.</p><p name="32e1" id="32e1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Ra’ed is derived from an Arabic word which means Pioneer. This reflects Ra’ed’s ambitions to become a leading game development and creative studio.</p><p name="bf7d" id="bf7d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The name itself, being a cross between read and raid, is meant to be awkward enough to encourage an unwitting memorization: It sticks in your mind. I am familiar with that, being with a company called Organimi, and correcting people almost every time they try to say the name.</p><p name="802e" id="802e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The R in Ra’ed pays tribute to the company’s subcontinental heritage. If you look closely enough, it bears resemblance to an elephant, a very common image associated with the subcontinent of the Mughal Era, the golden-age of the Islamic-Indian empire.</p><p name="32b1" id="32b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The R is placed within a box to symbolize a screen. Ra’ed after all is in the business of digital games and entertainment.</p><p name="bd5d" id="bd5d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The R itself is sectioned so that it can be moved around to spell out Ra’ed. I haven’t tried this myself but that’s pretty neat if I say so myself.</p><p name="8a9f" id="8a9f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Most of all, the the company’s name reflects the companies value’s that are derived form the Islamic heritage, tradition and values, and a yearning to return the glorious days of the past of being a leader.</p><p name="7deb" id="7deb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All this made my think deeply about what a company name means. Names like Google, Apple &amp; Samsung have become household names. But what do the really mean? Do the names have a historical significance, and do they reflect the companies’ values and purpose? Admittedly Apple, Google &amp; Samsung have become associated to certain <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/11/29/does_google_have_a_religion_partner/" data-href="http://www.salon.com/2013/11/29/does_google_have_a_religion_partner/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow noopener" target="_blank">values and bring forth an image in our head due to the products they make</a>. : Google is omni-present in the digital universe, while Apple &amp; Samsung make great hardware and software. However, those are brand-values, not values in the moral and philosophical sense of the word. I am trying to drive at the core “philosophy” behind the company name. With online name generators that play on synonyms and letters to auto generate a company name for you to cherry pick — to see a company putting such thought behind the philosophy behind a company name is refreshing.</p><p name="cfde" id="cfde" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">As for our conversation — all I could manage to say after hearing him out was, well…’Lets keep the name’.</p></div></div></section>
