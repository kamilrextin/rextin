We found a quiet room aptly named “Fortress of Solitude” and Basil was kind enough to give me some time out of his busy schedule to talk about his journey with SoundBrush, the experience with <a href="http://ycombinator.com/" data-href="http://ycombinator.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Y Combinator</a> and everything else (related to startups and tech)</p><blockquote name="fa30" id="fa30" class="graf graf--blockquote graf-after--p">SoundBrush recently won the VeloCity Venture Fund(VVF) with <a href="https://twitter.com/ted_livingston" data-href="https://twitter.com/ted_livingston" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Ted Livingston</a> (CEO <a href="http://kik.com/" data-href="http://kik.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--blockquote-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">KiK Messenger</a>) personally handing him the prize money. Post VVF, Basil and Jayson are busy developing new and exciting features for their iPad app. For those like me wondering if there will be an Android version — Sadly no.</blockquote><p name="eefc" id="eefc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Lets start with — What is SoundBrush and what’s the story behind it?</strong></p><p name="32f3" id="32f3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">SoundBrush is an iPad app that allows you to convert lines you draw on the screen into musical notes. The whole value behind drawing music is that all of a sudden you don’t have to learn how to play an instrument to create music. Right now what’s the best way to create music? Play an instrument. So we have completely flattened out that curve.</p><blockquote name="ae55" id="ae55" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--blockquote-strong">“You can think of SoundBrush as the Instagram from music”</strong></blockquote><p name="d631" id="d631" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Originally Jayson and I were sitting in front of a whiteboard coming up with a bunch of ideas to learn iOS. That’s how it started — finger painting. In 3 months we developed the first version while we were doing Co-Ops, working 8 hours a day and then developing on iOS for another 7 hours after we got home. That was literally our days and weekends! We moved into the VeloCity Garage in December and for the next month we worked all day and night — just popping by the house for a shower and nap then back to work again.</p><p name="d6f5" id="d6f5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So we launched it and the biggest thing we learned about why users are using it was that all of a sudden they didn’t need to learn an instrument anymore. They could just create music that they wanted. So this is what led us down the rabbit hole of asking ourselves what exactly are users looking for and is this actually solving the problem which is ‘anyone can make music’</p><p name="1d45" id="1d45" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We developed it further and we made a new version of SoundBrush and released it in June this year.</p><p name="9ff4" id="9ff4" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">For perspective:</p><ul class="postList"><li name="e7a1" id="e7a1" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p">Version 1 had 130,000 downloads in a year</li><li name="c5c3" id="c5c3" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li">Version 2 130,000 just within a month</li></ul><p name="c030" id="c030" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What got you the downloads? Any clever marketing tricks you can share with us?</strong></p><p name="c333" id="c333" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Well the first reason was that we switched the first version from a paid app to a free app — that definitely spiked our downloads. And secondly, Apple featured us in their App Store in the UK and we also landed a <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/12/soundbrush-an-app-that-lets-you-draw-music-turns-the-untrained-into-musicians/" data-href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/12/soundbrush-an-app-that-lets-you-draw-music-turns-the-untrained-into-musicians/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">feature on TechCrunch</a>.</p><p name="a8ef" id="a8ef" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Apple featured you in the App Store? How did that happen?</strong></p><p name="4f8b" id="4f8b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After WWDC (Apple Developer Conference) I emailed Apple, I called up Apple, I found every single contact at Apple and sent out a whole bunch of emails.</p><p name="db79" id="db79" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Incidentally one of the many emails I sent ended up in the right person’s inbox at the right time. Even though the queue was massive (after WWDC), he liked us enough to get us on the front page.</p><p name="438f" id="438f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Before that we had no downloads and it was really bleak but the Apple feature really got us going.</p><p name="f802" id="f802" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">And how did TechCrunch happen for you?</strong></p><p name="38fe" id="38fe" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I emailed <a href="https://twitter.com/johnbiggs" data-href="https://twitter.com/johnbiggs" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">John Biggs</a> who I met at a conference. I have emailed him before but he ignored every single one (haha).</p><p name="0807" id="0807" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">So I emailed him again with the subject “Apple featured App SoundBrush”. And I explained that Apple might feature us at 5pm today in the UK. Do you want to talk to us? He said Yes and that resulted in the<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/12/soundbrush-an-app-that-lets-you-draw-music-turns-the-untrained-into-musicians/" data-href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/12/soundbrush-an-app-that-lets-you-draw-music-turns-the-untrained-into-musicians/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">feature on TechCrunch</a>.</p><p name="dc31" id="dc31" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Did TechCrunch result in a server crash?</strong></p><p name="a735" id="a735" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Surprisingly no. Techcrunch resulted in a 15% increase in downloads. But surprisingly it is not as crazy as people think like 80% or 90%. It was really the Apple feature that really pushed everything and set things in motion.</p><p name="e37e" id="e37e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">All this with zero dollars spent on Marketing?</strong></p><p name="6fac" id="6fac" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Actually we spent $5000 dollars on a <a href="http://vimeo.com/68300539" data-href="http://vimeo.com/68300539" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">video</a> by <a href="http://www.arc-media.ca/" data-href="http://www.arc-media.ca/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Arc Media</a> which has been viewed 25,000 times on Vimeo as of now. Goal is 100,000 views but we’ll see.</p><p name="bc39" id="bc39" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We regularly check in on public metrics and see how we stack up against other startups from VeloCity and other startups in the space. If someone else has better numbers than we do at something then I talk to them about what they are doing and look at what we can do better. Metrics are crucial to our business and they keep us in check. We set benchmarks for ourselves to know how we are doing.</p><p name="ade3" id="ade3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Our primary marketing strategy is social media. Two instruments can be unlocked in the SoundBrush app if the user tweets about us or likes us on Facebook creating a viral loop on social networks.</p><p name="8c81" id="8c81" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Sharing and integrating with YouTube is another area we are looking at. Say a user has a couple of thousand views on YouTube but not as much on Discover (SoundBrush’s social sharing platform), we can pull those views from YouTube into Discover. Our target demographic is teenagers as they spend a lot of time on social networks so essentially we’re trying to penetrate more deeply into social networks. Another tactical item we’re looking into at the moment is talking to various YouTubers and inviting them to make a song with SoundBrush and share it with their audience.</p><p name="ba8c" id="ba8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Going back a little bit, back when you were starting out, did you know you were going to be targeting teenagers and how has that evolved with SoundBrush?</strong></p><p name="5417" id="5417" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Back then, I didn’t even know what a target market was! I thought oh yeah everyone’s going to download it and what not. That didn’t happen. Even for a while with the second version we were stuck and we didn’t know who the customers were. Are we going for the educational aspect? Children aspect? But we soon found out that the children aspect is a bad idea — Simply put kids will play with it for 5 min and never again.</p><p name="7f49" id="7f49" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When we looked at teenagers we also thought about how we can fix the</p><blockquote name="c25a" id="c25a" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithSingleQuote graf-after--p">‘This is a cool idea, I am going to play with it for 5 min and never again’.</blockquote><p name="80ae" id="80ae" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Discover — the SoundBrush music discovery network played a huge role in that, which is something kids can’t participate in it.</p><p name="4f10" id="4f10" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/shellhammer" data-href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/shellhammer" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Brett Shellhammer</a> and <a href="http://mikekirkup.com/" data-href="http://mikekirkup.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Mike Kirkup</a> have been great mentors for marketing for us.</p><p name="3d48" id="3d48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What about people who say ‘There are just too many apps out there?”</strong></p><p name="5e5a" id="5e5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There are too many websites, doesn’t mean you stop making websites. We always envisioned it as an iPad app because we feel that the iPad is still generally neglected.</p><p name="b10e" id="b10e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">As a CS Guy — how was the transition from coding to focusing on marketing/business for you personally?</strong></p><p name="03dc" id="03dc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That’s a change that I had to go through the tough way. You focus on the product so much that you forget about the signup page. How are they going to go in if there is no signup page! Most people focus on the product and never the signup page. And it’s not just about building a signup but focusing on the right areas. That’s something a lot of people including ourselves have struggled with.</p><p name="e770" id="e770" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">So you’re the marketing/business guy then?</strong></p><p name="a94b" id="a94b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I am responsible for strategy and other business matters. Usually I go to Jayson and propose a crazy idea without any back-thought — one example is when we released V-2 for SoundBrush as a different app and not as an update. We did not have backwards compatibility. So instead of reworking the code, we decided to release the new update as a separate app.</p><p name="1258" id="1258" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The role I see for myself in the future is Product Lead and Jayson as the Technology Lead.</p><p name="66dd" id="66dd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">So how did you guys meet?</strong></p><p name="7b1b" id="7b1b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We met at residence on campus during first year and when I moved to a friend’s house afterwards, Jayson ended up taking one of the rooms there as well. It was after that I asked him for help on a project (LeafNotes); he was the only web developer I knew back then that we become close friends. After helping for 2-3 days, he offered to work with me on the project and it started snowball from there.</p><p name="28c6" id="28c6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">It’s the two of us right now and we’re hiring two Co-ops, including one for social media and community.</p><p name="49d3" id="49d3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">So what are some of the things you’re looking for when you’re hiring co-ops?</strong></p><p name="4f80" id="4f80" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We’re looking for personality and then skills, in that order of importance. If you don’t have the personality or ability to bring new ideas to the table then you are no better than a hired developer from Elance in my opinion. That’s not something we’re looking for. I want this (SoundBrush) to be part of who you are.</p><p name="c1a5" id="c1a5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Why do a startup? Why not go to Google, Facebook, Desire2Learn or you name it?</strong></p><p name="90b6" id="90b6" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When you’re working on a startup everything you do can’t be marginal by definition. Everything has to have an impact. When you work at Google or Facebook or most other corporation, almost everything you do is marginal to the bottom line of the business. You messing up or succeeding isn’t going to make or break the business.</p><p name="2ed1" id="2ed1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Jayson and I come from an audio/music and graphics background. Jayson is an instrumentalist and I know more about digital audio music techniques and graphics design. It was a good match for us to work on SoundBrush together.</p><p name="8353" id="8353" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Wait, you have a Graphics Design background? So you did the visual design for SoundBrush?</strong></p><p name="9036" id="9036" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">All the UI and images except for the brush I drew out and we have over 8,000 images in SoundBrush . We’re actually thinking of adding 25 more instruments so I’ll be working on those graphics as well.</p><p name="0d8c" id="0d8c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">So tell me about Y Combinator and </strong><a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/329243664901623808" data-href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/329243664901623808" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">infamous tweet by Paul Graham</strong></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">.</strong></p><p name="7da9" id="7da9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We interviewed for Y Combinator — what actually ended up happening was that we got two interviews at Y Combinator. They interviewed us once and they couldn’t decide. So they interviewed us again and decided no.</p><p name="c2e7" id="c2e7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The story behind the tweet by Paul Graham is a very interesting one. He never actually interviewed us! He wasn’t even in the room when we got interviewed. During the second interview <a href="http://paulgraham.com/articles.html" data-href="http://paulgraham.com/articles.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Paul Graham</a> heard SoundBrush through the wall. He stuck his head through the door, comes in stands next to us and says</p><blockquote name="d0a7" id="d0a7" class="graf graf--blockquote graf--startsWithSingleQuote graf-after--p">‘Oh Wow that’s Cool!’</blockquote><p name="6b8f" id="6b8f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--blockquote">And everyone ends up playing with SoundBrush. We’re sitting there going ‘hey guys, what about the questions?’</p><p name="a013" id="a013" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Anyway so while we continued our interview <a href="http://paulgraham.com/articles.html" data-href="http://paulgraham.com/articles.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Paul Graham</a> takes my iPad and disappears into the next room and that’s when the <a href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/329243664901623808" data-href="https://twitter.com/paulg/status/329243664901623808" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">tweet happened</a>. Before the interview we were warned by everyone that don’t let any of the partners or Paul Graham have your iPad because they will get distracted with it.</p><p name="fb70" id="fb70" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">That was a very interesting experience to say the least.</p><p name="fdc9" id="fdc9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Silicon Valley vs Kitchener/Waterloo: if you had gotten into YC would you have stayed back in Silicon Valley?</strong></p><p name="8648" id="8648" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">There’s a lot of opportunity here and there’s a lot of opportunity in Silicon Valley. I haven’t lived there so I can’t comment but Kitchener/Waterloo does have a lot of opportunities right now.</p><p name="7c5a" id="7c5a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Speaking of which, what are some of the best things about being in Kitchener/Waterloo as a startup?</strong></p><p name="c401" id="c401" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">VeloCity Garage, Communitech easily said. Not to mention UW and the Co-Op system. With the Co-op processes not only can I hire quickly and end the contract quickly, I also get a lot of good feedback on the interview process.</p><p name="2397" id="2397" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">What’s your take on the idea vs execution debate?</strong></p><p name="0520" id="0520" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Execution is more important in my opinion but even a small idea can make a product great. It’s all about how you execute it.</p><p name="abb2" id="abb2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Looking back on your journey so far, was their any pivotal moment that you look back on? As a company?</strong></p><p name="4d48" id="4d48" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">I don’t think we have had our pivotal moment. I see this as a long journey. We do celebrate our successes but we always try not to get caught up in it and move on to the next challenge.</p><p name="00cb" id="00cb" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Special Shout Out to </strong><a href="http://mikekirkup.com/" data-href="http://mikekirkup.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Mike Kirkup</strong></a><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> &amp; </strong><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/shellhammer" data-href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/shellhammer" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Brett Shellhammer</strong></a></p></div></div></section><section name="54a7" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="2041" id="2041" class="graf graf--p graf--leading graf--trailing"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">Re-eposted from </em><a href="http://blog.kwstartups.com/" data-href="http://blog.kwstartups.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">KW Startups Blog</em></a></p></div></div></section>
