It&#39;s quite the buzz these days in B2B Marketing circles, with different vendors with hefty price tags and ominous black boxes selling their wares. However let&#39;s break it down; B2B technology vendors are notorious for vague copy on their website, without actually explaining what or how they do it. I guess that helps them fuel the &#39;demo request&#39; forms.<br><br>Traditional lead scoring is based on 2 dimensions:<br>- Straight up things like job title, company size (a proxy for revenue which means &#39;disposable money to spend on technologies&#39;) and mostly country and other such things.<br>- Behaviour, which means if they&#39;ve actually been to your website/blog a couple of times and read or downloaded some eBooks and such.<br><br>Note: Remember to have negative scoring for things like email bounced, blank title, unsubscribed from marketing emails and such. Otherwise you&#39;re lead score will, in theory, trend towards infinity.<br><br>Where lead scoring falls short? A couple of things, the world isn&#39;t perfect and data isn&#39;t clean. Someone might self identify as a VP of Marketing but in reality they might be a Marketing Manager. It&#39;s all user generated anyway. Secondly if you use a third party data service to augment your lead records, you have a single point of failure. If the third party returns null or wrong data, your whole model is thrown off. <br><br>So what is predictive lead scoring? It&#39;s the idea (<a href="https://tomwentworth.com/building-a-data-science-driven-marketing-team-3c01e360d74#.s0hgh6dxe" data-href="https://tomwentworth.com/building-a-data-science-driven-marketing-team-3c01e360d74#.s0hgh6dxe" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">data science anyone?</a>) that you look at a sample size of all the customers you got and look for similarities. If you have a large enough sample size and enough data points, there might be some commonalities like certain industries, behaviours (attended your webinar twice around &#39;Lead Management for High Performing Marketing Teams&#39;), spent 3 minutes look around your pricing page, had job titles within a certain area or other overlaps. These themes give you data points on what your ideal customer profile looks like and instead of having a linear lead scoring model, you have a weighted one. After all, not all behaviours are created equal, some are more equal then others. The challenge of-course that the process from visit to customer isn&#39;t linear or simple. But a large enough sample size offers insights.<br>Should you then drop a hefty sum on a predictive lead scoring tool? Nope - Hubspot already offers it in built into their tool and you can build one yourself using excel by using regression analysis. What is regression analysis is a project for me for next week.<br><br>The second article talked about how traditional excel sales/revenue growth models often are based on historical funnel conversion rates which leads to total lead/MQL target madness. Yes, I&#39;ve been there. But historical conversion rates aren&#39;t predictive of the future, they&#39;re an opportunity of improvement. If you MQL targets or lead targets are 8000 a month, then there&#39;s definitely something leaky in your funnel and it&#39;s better to fix that. What is the bottle neck? is it the Sales Qualified stage? Is that because of head count? Or is there a broken process? For example your funnel looks like this:<br><br>Lead -&gt; MQL = 90%<br>MQL -&gt; SAL = 40%<br>SAL -&gt; SQL = 8%<br>SQL -&gt; Opp = 50%<br>Opp -&gt; Customer = 60%<br><br>It&#39;s clear that there&#39;s a 8% conversion rate that is causing the MQL/Lead number to inflate beyond control. What is causing that? What can be improved? If only 8% of the leads are being qualified by sales, what is happening to the rest of the 92%? Are they thrown out and replaces by new MQLs? Why not recycle them? Or is it simply that the MQL&#39;s are not true MQL&#39;s and hence not replying or engaging with sales? Can the channels/messaging and positioning be shuffled to better explain what the product does for whom so those who do fill out a form actually know what they&#39;re getting into? One too many B2B SaaS products have vague ambiguous copy on their website, but interesting blog/ebooks that someone will download with no intention of buying the product or rather no idea what the product does. <br><br>Process is essential but hard to get right but essential to the demand generation funnel. Hard to get right because there&#39;s two &#39;departments&#39; on a constant head butt with each other: sales &amp; marketing. Traditionally, marketing is responsible for Leads -&gt; MQL and Sales is SQL -&gt; Customer. But both have varying incentives in places. I am all for SDR/BDR teams being under the Demand Generation/Marketing teams, to help simplify the process changes and align goals. <br><br>Last thing: Product Qualified leads. This is a concept on freemium products, where a user has a free trial or free version and hits a &#39;wall&#39;. The wall can be a premium feature leading to a landing page or hitting the max quota on their plan or something of the sort. However I find this only works in the case of freemium products, if your product has no entry point to a account and usage, this model would not work.<br><br>Here are all the links:<br><a href="https://tomwentworth.com/stop-the-lead-scoring-madness-5f6b94e5859a#.hv7j7r3s9" data-href="https://tomwentworth.com/stop-the-lead-scoring-madness-5f6b94e5859a#.hv7j7r3s9" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stop the Lead Scoring Madness.</a><br><a href="http://www.slideshare.net/MikeVolpe/lead-scoring-how-a-stanford-engineer-and-mit-mba-approaches-it-ilya-mirman-onshape-growth-camp-june-2016" data-href="http://www.slideshare.net/MikeVolpe/lead-scoring-how-a-stanford-engineer-and-mit-mba-approaches-it-ilya-mirman-onshape-growth-camp-june-2016" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Lead Scoring Models [Slide Share]</a><br><a href="https://expand.openviewpartners.com/what-is-a-pql-3d724548ba06?gi=55b103e2d861#.qh380epfd" data-href="https://expand.openviewpartners.com/what-is-a-pql-3d724548ba06?gi=55b103e2d861#.qh380epfd" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Product Qualified Lead</a><br><a href="https://tomwentworth.com/before-you-agree-to-widening-the-top-of-your-lead-funnel-c740398014f2#.laiewui1k" data-href="https://tomwentworth.com/before-you-agree-to-widening-the-top-of-your-lead-funnel-c740398014f2#.laiewui1k" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Before You Widen The Top of the Funnel</a><br><br>Before I go, here&#39;s a fantastic r<a href="http://fortune.com/cruise-automation-general-motors-driverless-cars/" data-href="http://fortune.com/cruise-automation-general-motors-driverless-cars/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ead by Erin from Fortune on Cruise Automation that sold to GM Motors for a a mind boggling amount of money and how GM and Cruise is keeping things alive.</a><br><br><br>It&#39;s been a while.
